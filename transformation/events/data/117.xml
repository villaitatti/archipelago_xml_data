	<Synopsis>The Dominican Patriarch asks the Canons to build an apartment for him in the island. This is built on the southern-est corner of the island, in front of the vegetable garden and &quot;near the old building&quot;. It consists of many rooms, a living room equipped with a fireplace and a small loggia (lobiolam). The rooms are remembered as small but cozy (prelibatae) in a document dated 1643. In this description, one room is mentioned as &quot;la camera d'oro&quot; because it was decorated with gilded carvings.  </Synopsis>
