	<Synopsis>To fulfil a vow made during the plague epidemic in 1630, Monsignor Lazzaroni built an image of the Virgin on cedar wood. He exposed it in his church of Sant'Angelo while waiting for building a new chapel, modelled on the Holy House of Loreto. After several attempts to locate the Holy House in the churches of Sant'Angelo, San Lazzaro, and Tolentini, he was finally granted the space in the church of San Clemente.</Synopsis>
